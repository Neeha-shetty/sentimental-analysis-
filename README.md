Here’s a README template for your **Sentiment Analysis** project based on the repository link:

---

# Sentiment Analysis

This project implements **Sentiment Analysis** using Python to classify textual data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The goal is to explore natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze customer feedback or other textual data.

---

## Features

- Preprocessing of textual data (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Sentiment classification using machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.).
- Visualization of sentiment analysis results.
- Interactive notebook for running and testing code.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Notebook**: Google Colab

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neeha-shetty/sentimental-analysis-.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Open the Google Colab notebook:
   [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Neeha-shetty/sentimental-analysis-/blob/main/YourNotebookName.ipynb)
   
2. Run the notebook step by step:
   - Upload your dataset or use the default one.
   - Train the sentiment analysis model.
   - Test the model and visualize the results.

## Future Enhancements

- Use deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for improved accuracy.
- Expand to multilingual sentiment analysis.
- Deploy the model using Flask/Django for real-time sentiment analysis.
